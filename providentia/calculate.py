           which is easy to interpret. A perfect model has a COE = 1. As noted by Legates
           although the COE has no lower bound, a value of COE = 0.0 has a fundamental meaning.
           It implies that the model is no more able to predict the observed values

           variation in the observed values than can the observed mean, such a model can have
           no predictive advantage. For negative values of COE, the model is less effective than
           the observed mean in predicting the variation in the observations.

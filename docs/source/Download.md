The tool has set locations where it grabs the observational/experiment data on the **esarchive**:

* GHOST observational data: `/esarchive/obs/ghost`
* Non-GHOST observational data: `/esarchive/obs/`
* Interpolated experiment data: `/esarchive/recon/exp_interp`

The entire data collection comprises **several terabytes**, therefore it is not recommended to download the entire archive.

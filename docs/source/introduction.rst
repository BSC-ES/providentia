About

Providentia consists of these two main features:

* Dashboard, designed to allow on-the-fly analysis of BSC experiment output.
* Offline reports, designed to obtain complete reports and carry out in-depth analysis of BSC experiment output.

This wiki has been written to help users develop their analysis using the Providentia tool. If you want to use your own experiments in Providentia, you will need to interpolate their output to the observations network of your interest using
Providentia Interpolation in advance.

If you encounter any error, please check the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page. For other problems, you can create an issue in GitLab or contact us directly.
